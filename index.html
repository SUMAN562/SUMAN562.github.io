											</header>
											<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3>How will we make it possible?</h3>
											<p>Over the last decade or so, the manufacturing sector across the world has been shifting to Industry 4.0, 
												calling for a renewed look at the kind of skilled workforce required to run the factories of tomorrow. 
												A Nasscom report published earlier this year expects large economies like US, UK, China, Japan and India 
												to invest in excess of $100 billion in Industry 4.0 over the next three to four years, paving the way for
												a transformed industrial landscape across the world.  This fresh investment, expected to be committed between
												now and 2025, is equal to the investment made over the past decade or so, which highlights the speed at which
												the transformation is taking place.</p>

												<h2><a href="#">MENTAL HEALTH: HOW TATA STEEL MANAGED THE MENTAL WELL-BEING OF ITS EMPLOYEES DURING THE PANDEMIC</a></h2>
											</header>
											<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3>You should probably check this out</h3>
											<p>Over the years, healthcare has been one of the key benefits that has helped strengthen the relationship between employers 
												and employees. Large organisations in India and the world over have often built hospitals, health centres, and other facilities 
												for staff members and even extended these facilities to local communities. As employee locations became geographically 
												diverse, comprehensive medical insurance coverage also became a key benefit. With new-age tech coming in, health 
												benefits were extended to gym memberships and other app-based programmes for consultation with doctors.<br>
												Over the last century, Tata Steel, has emerged as one of the most employee-friendly companies in the world and is 
												known for creating industry standards in the field of human resources. We have been a pioneer in employee welfare 
												schemes and community initiatives, even before the legislation mandated them. A few of these include the 8-hour
												workday, Leave with Pay scheme, and the Workers’ Provident Fund Scheme, all of which were adopted by the International
												Labour Organisation and enacted by the law in India.<br>On mental well-being too, we have been a pioneer. 
												We believe a healthy mind and body makes a happy human being. We want our employees to lead a happy, healthy, and 
												balanced life which will help them perform at their best, both professionally and personally and to ensure this we 
												support our employees through multiple initiatives and an enabling ecosystem.
